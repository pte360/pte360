      "question":"All the vehicles that are being driven on the road need fuel in order to function. In our world, there are two fuels that are used to run vehicles; one is petrol and the other one is diesel, with the former one being more widespread and commonly used. In countries like USA, diesel engines are <select> </select>whereas in India, it isn’t rare to find cars which run on diesel. There are quite a lot of differences between petrol and diesel engines. We all might have wondered at a point of time about why some vehicles run on petrol while others run on diesel. The answer isn’t a simple one, <select> </select>simple to understand. There are many differences between the engines of both the fuel types. The main difference is the fact that petrol is volatile than diesel, meaning that it burns easily whereas diesel is less volatile. Based on these differences, we can understand how and why the engines are designed the way they are. The petrol engines use spark plugs to <select> </select>the fuel whereas the diesel engines use fuel injectors. The air compression needs to be done in the case of diesel engine whereas the petrol engines start by mixing air and petrol to form a combustible mixture. As the diesel engines make use of air compressors, the compression ratio in diesel engines is larger and thereby results in higher power generation than the petrol engines. The diesel engines are also heavier in mass and are expensive to maintain when compared to their petrol counterparts. Though diesel is less volatile and burns slower than petrol, it still releases greater volume of emissions when compared to diesel. Therefore, by keeping all these observations in mind, it is <select> </select>that the usage of petrol vehicles is environmental friendly when compared to diesel engines.",

This technique is mainly used to <select> </select> a cause and effect relationship between a problem and its root cause.

Separating species would then be a simple task of sequencing this tiny bit of DNA. Dr Hebert proposed part of a gene called cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) as suitable to the task. All animals have it. It seems to vary enough, but not too much, to act as a reliable marker. And it is easily <select> </select> , because it is one of a handful of genes found outside the cell nucleus, in structures called mitochondria. Barcoding has taken off rapidly since Dr Hebert invented it. When the idea was proposed, it was expected to be a <select> </select> to taxonomists trying to name the world’s millions of species.

By the end of a wide-ranging and remarkably <select> </select> research career that spanned nearly 75 years–from his first scientific publication at age 10 to work still in progress when he died at 84–Piaget had developed several new fields of science: developmental psychology, cognitive theory and what came to be called genetic epistemology. Although not an educational reformer, he championed a way of thinking about children that provided the foundation for today’s education-reform movements. It was a shift comparable to the displacement of stories of “noble savages” and “cannibals” by modern anthropology. One might say that Piaget was the first to take children’s thinking seriously.",

      "question":"Movement in painting that <select> </select> in France in the 1860s and had enormous influence in European and North American painting in the late 19th century. The Impressionists wanted to <select> </select> real life, to paint straight from nature, and to capture the changing effects of light. The term was first used abusively to describe Claude Monet’s painting Impression: Sunrise (1872). The other leading Impressionists included Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, Edouard Manet, Camille Pissarro, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Alfred Sisley, but only Monet remained devoted to Impressionist ideas throughout his career. The core of the Impressionist group was formed in the early 1860s by Monet, Renoir, and Sisley, who met as students and enjoyed painting in the open air – one of the hallmarks of Impressionism. They met other members of the Impressionist circle through Paris café society. They never made up a formal group, but they organized eight group exhibitions between 1874 and 1886, at the first of which the name Impressionism was applied. Their styles were diverse, but all <select> </select> with effects of light and movement created with distinct brushstrokes and <select> </select> of colour dabbed side-by-side on the canvas rather than mixed on the palette. By the 1880s the movement’s central impulse had dispersed, and a number of new styles were emerging, later described as post-Impressionism. British Impressionism had a major influence on the more <select> </select> and <select> </select> British painters in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many of the painters affected were in the circle of Walter Sickert, who spent much of his career in France and was an influential figure who inspired many younger artists. His friend and exact contemporary Philip Wilson Steer is generally regarded as the most outstanding British Impressionist.",

      "question":"Called Chomolungma (“goddess mother of the world”) in Tibet and Sagarmatha (“goddess of the sky”) in Nepal, Mount Everest once went by the pedestrian name of Peak XV among Westerners. That was before <select> </select> established that it was the highest mountain on Earth, a fact that came as something of a surprise—Peak XV had seemed lost in the crowd of other formidable Himalayan peaks, many of which gave the <select> </select> of greater height. In 1852 the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India measured Everest’s elevation as 29,002 feet above sea level. This figure remained the officially <select> </select> height for more than one hundred years. In 1955 it was adjusted by a mere 26 feet to 29,028 (8,848 m). The mountain received its official name in 1865 in honor of Sir George Everest, the British Surveyor General from 1830—1843 who had mapped the Indian subcontinent. He had some <select> </select> about having his name bestowed on the peak, arguing that the mountain should retain its local appellation, the standard policy of geographical societies. Before the Survey of India, a number of other mountains ranked supreme in the eyes of the world. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Andean peak Chimborazo was considered the highest. At a relatively unremarkable 20,561 feet (6,310 m), it is in fact nowhere near the highest, <select> </select> by about thirty other Andean peaks and several dozen in the Himalayas. In 1809, the Himalayan peak Dhaulagiri (26,810 ft.; 8,172 m) was declared the ultimate, only to be shunted aside in 1840 by Kanchenjunga (28,208 ft.; 8,598 m), which today ranks third. Everest’s status has been unrivaled for the last century-and-a-half, but not without a few threats.",

This does not <select> </select> mean the lessons were wasted. Millions of Spanish speakers use neither standard Latin American Spanish nor Castilian, which predominate in U.S. schools. The confusion is partly political—the Spanish-speaking world is very diverse. Spanish is the language of 19 separate countries and Puerto Rico. This means that there is no one standard dialect. The most common Spanish dialect taught in the U.S. is standard Latin American. It is sometimes called “Highland” Spanish since it is generally spoken in the <select> </select> areas of Latin America. While each country retains its own <select> </select> and has some unique vocabulary, residents of countries such as Mexico, Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia generally speak Latin American Spanish, especially in urban centers. This dialect is noted for its <select> </select> of each letter and its strong “r” sounds. This Spanish was spoken in Spain in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and was brought to the Americas by the early colonists. However, the Spanish of Madrid and of northern Spain, called Castilian, developed <select> </select> that never reached the New World. These include he pronunciation of “ci” and “ce” as “th.” In Madrid, “gracias” (thank you) becomes “gratheas” (as opposed to “gras-see-as” in Latin America.) Another difference is the use of the word “vosotros” (you all, or you guys) as the informal form of “ustedes” in Spain. Castilian sounds to Latin Americans much like British English sounds to U.S. residents.",

While the use of human smallpox vaccine was controversial, E. Jenner came up with bovine smallpox vaccine in 1796; this new method also faced controversy, but continued to be universalized.

Jenner named the substance “vaccine” after the Latin word “vacca” which means “cow,” and thus the process of giving vaccine became “vaccination”",

Pearson has <select> </select> together to work of hundreds of researchers around the world to produce a unique millennium technology calendar that gives the latest dates when we can expect hundreds of key breakthroughs and discoveries to take place.

Pearson also <select> </select> a breakthrough in computer human links. “By linking directly to our nervous system, computers could pick up what we feel and, hopefully, simulate feeling too so that we can start to develop full sensory environments, rather like the holidays in Total Recall or the Star Trek holodeck,”he says. But that, Pearson points out, is only the start of man-machine integration:”It will be the beginning of the long process of integration that will ultimately lead to a fully electronic human before the end of the next century.”Through his research, Pearson is able to put dates to most of the breakthroughs that can be predicted. However, there are still no forecasts for when faster-than-light travel will be <select> </select> e, or when human cloning will be perfected, or when time travel will be possible. But he does <select> </select> social problems as a result of technological advances.

      "question":"Have you ever wondered what our future is like?Practically all people exhibit a desire to predict their future <select> </select> .Most people seem inclined to undertake this task using causal reasoning.First we generally recognize that future circumstances are <select> </select> caused or conditioned by present ones.We learn that getting an education will affect how much money we earn later and that swimming beyond the reef may bring an unhappy encounter with a shark. Second,people also learn that such patterns of cause and effect are probabilistic in nature.That is,the effects occur more often when the causes occur than when the causes are <select> </select> , but not always.Thus,students learn that studying hard <select> </select> good grades in most instances,but not every time.Science makes these concepts of causality and probability more explicit and provides techniques for dealing with then more accurately than does causal human inquiry.In looking at ordinary human inquiry,we need to distinguish between prediction and understanding.Often,even if we don’t understand why,we are willing to act on the basis of a demonstrated predictive ability. Whatever the primitive drives that motivate human beings,satisfying them depends heavily on the ability to <select> </select> future circumstances.The attempt to predict is often played in a context of knowledge and understanding.If you can understand why certain regular patterns occur, you can predict better than if you simply observe those patterns.Thus,human inquiry aims <select> </select> answering both “what” and “why” question,and we pursue these goals by observing and figuring out.",

      "question":"For many people today, reading is no longer relaxation.To keep up their work they must read letters, reports, trade publications, interoffice communications, not to mention newspapers and magazines: a never-ending flood of words.In getting a job or advancing in one, the ability to read and comprehend .Qickly can mean the difference between success and failure.Yet the unfortunate fact is that most of us are <select> </select> readers. Most of us develop poor reading habits at an early age, and never get over them. The main deficiency lies in the actual stuff of language itself-words.Taken individually, words have <select> </select> meaning until they are strung together into phrased, sentences and paragraphs. <select> </select> , however, the untrained reader does not read groups of words.He laboriously reads one word at a time, often regressing to reread words or passages.Regression, the tendency to look back over what you have just read, is a common bad habit in reading.Another habit which <select> </select> down the speed of reading is vocalization—sounding each word either orally or mentally as <select> </select> reads. To overcome these bad habits, some reading clinics use a device called an accelerator, which moves a bar (or curtain) down the page at a predetermined speed.The bar is set at a slightly faster rate than the reader finds comfortable, in order to“stretch”him.The accelerator forces the reader to read fast, <select> </select> word-by-word reading, regression and subvocalization, practically impossible. At first comprehension is sacrificed for speed.But when you learn to read ideas and concepts, you will not only read faster,but your comprehension will improve. Many people have found <select> </select> reading skill drastically improved after some training.Take Charlce Au, a business manager, for instance, his reading rate was a reasonably good 172 words a minute before the training,now it is an excellent 1,378 words a minute.He is delighted that how he can get through a lot more reading material in a short period of time.",

Called carbonado or “black” diamonds, the <select> </select>stones are found in Brazil and the Central African Republic. They are <select> </select>for being the color of charcoal and full of frothy bubbles. The diamonds, which can weigh in at more than 3,600 carats, can also have a face that looks like melted glass. Because of their <select> </select>appearance, the diamonds are <select> </select> as gemstones. But they do have industrial applications and were used in the drill bits that helped dig the Panama Canal. Now a team led by Stephen Haggerty of Florida International University in Miami has presented a new study suggesting that the odd stones were brought to Earth by asteroid billions of years ago. The findings were published online in the journal Astrophysical Journal Letters on December 20. The scientists exposed polished pieces of carbonado to extremely intense infrared light. The test revealed the presence of much hydrogen carbon bonds, indicating that the diamonds probably formed in a hydrogen—rich environment — such as that found in space. The diamonds also showed strong similarities to tiny nanodiamonds, which are frequently found in meteorites. “They’re not <select> </select>” Haggerty said, “but they’re very similar.” Astrophysicists, he added, have developed theories predicting that nanodiamonds form easily in the titanic stellar explosions called supernovas, which scatter debris through interstellar space. The deposits in the Central African Republic and Brazil, he said, <select> </select>come from the impact of diamond rich asteroid billions of years ago, when South America and Africa were joined.",

      "question":"Plants &amp; Animals are a Montreal-based indie rock trio that began playing together as kids. Touring arduously for about five years after their proper full-length debut in 2008, they pretty much made their records on the go until 2013. So the band’s decision to be slow, deliberate, and thorough on their latest offering, Waltzed in from the Rumbling, represents a major change of pace. Finally sleeping in their in own beds while recording, the band assembled the album over the course of nine seasons. It’s a return to their origins, but it also pushes <select> </select>forward. The aesthetic varies wildly and wonderfully from track to track, each song having its own <select> </select>seal but somehow still melding cohesively as a body of work. Jangling guitars, drums leaning toward the off-kilter swing of J Dilla, found sounds, a hint of shoegaze, and unorthodox instrumentation come together to keep the ear constantly engaged with a feeling of constant evolution. They found an antique guiro next to a broken VCR and recorded both. They made an empty fridge sound like a timpani drum. They recorded gossip on a city bus. They brought in classical string flourishes. They sometimes left mistakes if they felt they were perfectly imperfect. It’s truly DIY, but with a feel of big production value that makes the album soar. Contemplative lyrics anchor the album through all the exploratory <select> </select>. The words are delivered melodically, belying their potency, but listening beyond the pretty aesthetic reveals piercing observations and an undeniable translation of feeling. The simplicity of the penetrating refrain on the three-part mini <select> </select>“Je Voulais Te Dire” is a paragon of how the lyrics effortlessly cut through the instrumentation. Guitarist/ vocalist Warren Spicer sings “It’s only love, but you want it bad,” encompassing how we try to avoid and downplay our desire for love and affection, but ultimately search and long for it anyway.",

In a report released on January 23, a team of British researchers says the deadly upwelling began when an exploratory gas well punched through a layer of rock 9,300 feet (2,800 meters) below the surface, allowing hot, high-pressure water to escape. The water carried mud <select> </select>the surface, where it has spread <select> </select> a region 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) in diameter in the eight months since the eruption began. The mud volcano is similar to a gusher or blowout, which occur in oil drilling when oil or gas squirt to the surface, the team says. This upwelling, however, spews out a volume of mud equivalent to a dozen Olympic swimming pools each day. Although the eruption isn’t as <select> </select> as a conventional volcano, more than a dozen people died when a natural gas pipeline ruptured. The research team, who published their findings in the February issue of GSA Today, also estimate that the volcano, called Lusi, will leave more than 11,000 people permanently displaced.",

      "question":"It’s probably one of the most overused phrases in job-hunting, but also one of the most underutilized by jobseekers: dress for success, in job-hunting, first <select> </select>are critical. Remember, you are marketing a product — yourself — to a potential employer, and the first thing the employer sees when greeting you is your attire; thus, you must make every effort to have the proper dress for the type of job you are seeking. Will dressing properly get you the job? Of course not, but it will give you a competitive edge and a <select> </select>first impression. Should you be judged by what you wear? Perhaps not, but the reality is, of course, that you are judged. Throughout the entire job-seeking process employers use short-cuts – heuristics or rules of thumb – to save time. With cover letters, it’s the opening paragraph and a quick scan of your qualifications. With resumes, it is a quick scan of your accomplishments. With the job interview, it’s how you’re dressed that sets the <select> </select>of the interview. How should you dress? Dressing conservatively is always the safest route, but you should also try and do a little investigating of your <select> </select>employer so that what you wear to the interview makes you look as though you fit in with the organization. If you overdress (which is rare but can happen) or underdress (the more likely scenario), the potential employer may feel that you don’t care enough about the job.",

      "question":"The invasion of non-indigenous plants is considered a primary threat to integrity and function of ecosystems. However, there is little quantitative or <select> </select>evidence for ecosystem impacts of invasive species. Justifications for control are often based on potential, but not presently realized, recognized or quantified, negative impacts. Should lack of scientific certainty about impacts of non-indigenous species result in postponing measures to prevent degradation? Recently, management of purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria), has been criticized for (1) lack of evidence demonstrating negative impacts of L. salicaria, and (2) management using biocontrol for lack of evidence documenting the failure of conventional control methods. Although little quantitative evidence on negative impacts on native wetland biota and wetland function was available at the onset of the control program in 1985, recent work has demonstrated that the invasion of purple loosestrife into North American freshwater wetlands alters <select> </select>rates and nutrient cycling, leads to reductions in wetland plant diversity, reduces pollination and seed output of the native Lythrum alatum, and reduces habitat <select> </select> for specialized wetland bird species such as black terns, least bitterns, pied-billed grebes, and marsh wrens. Conventional methods (physical, mechanical or chemical), have continuously failed to <select> </select>(han che su lay lan cua) the spread of purple loosestrife or to provide satisfactory control. Although a number of generalist insect and bird species utilize purple loosestrife, wetland habitat specialists are excluded by <select> </select>(giam tu tu cai gi) of L. salicaria. We conclude that (1) negative ecosystem impacts of purple loosestrife in North America justify control of the species and that (2) <select> </select>effects of purple loosestrife on wetland systems and biota and the potential benefits of control outweigh potential risks associated with the introduction of biocontrol agents.",

      "question":"Many people today think of culture in the way that it was thought of in Europe during the 18th and early 19th centuries. This <select> </select> of culture reflected inequalities within European societies and their colonies around the world. This understanding of culture equates culture with civilization and contrasts both with nature or non-civilization. According to this understanding of culture, some countries are more civilized than others, and some people are more cultured than others. Theorists like Matthew Arnold (1822-1888) believed that culture is simply that which is created by “the best that has been thought and said in the world” (p. 6).[5] Anything that doesn’t <select> </select> into this category is labeled as chaos or anarchy. From this perspective, culture is closely tied to cultivation, which is the progressive refinement of human <select> </select>. In practice, culture referred to elite goods and activities such as haute cuisine, high fashion or haute couture, museum-caliber art and classical music. The word cultured referred to people who knew about and took part in these activities. For example, someone who used culture in this sense might <select> </select> that classical music is more refined than music by working-class people, such as jazz or the indigenous music traditions of aboriginal peoples.",

Only a small <select> </select> of young people become recidivist offenders. In a functioning society, crime <select> </select> is part of everyday life. While prevention can be all-pervasive at the grassroots, it is oddly neglected in mass media and political discourses. When politicians, talkback radio hosts and newspaper editorialists pontificate about crime and <select> </select> remedies, it is comparatively rare for <select> </select> to mention prevention. Overwhelmingly, emphasis is on policing, sentencing and other ‘law and order’ responses.",

We propose extending the concept of cuteness beyond visual features to include positive infant sounds and smells.

Some of the most <select> </select>buildings of the past include the pyramids in Egypt, the skinny towers stretching towards the sky in Italian hill towns, and the gothic cathedrals of France. While these types of buildings may look very different from each other, they all have one thing in <select> </select> . They were built with masonry or stone walls supporting most of the weight (so-called load-bearing walls), including that of the floors, the people, and everything the rooms contained. Because of this, the height of these buildings was limited by how massive and heavy they had to be at the base. Two <select> </select>in the 19th century paved the way for a whole new type of building: the skyscraper. The first was the development of a safe elevator. Primitive elevators of various designs had been used for centuries, and starting in the mid-19th century, steam-operated elevators were used to move materials in factories, mines, and warehouses. But these elevators were not <select> </select>safe for people; if the cable broke, they would plummet to the bottom of the elevator shaft. Then in 1853, an American inventor named Elisha Graves Otis developed a safety device that kept elevators from falling if a cable should break. This new development had an enormous impact on public confidence. And later in the century, the switch to an electric motor made the elevator a practical solution to the problem of getting up and down tall buildings.",

Rather than moving about randomly, amoebas and plankton employ sophisticated <select> </select>to look for food and might travel in a way that optimizes their foraging. <select> </select>have long tried to explain how creatures of all sizes search for food. However, single-celled organisms such as bacteria seem to move in no particular direction in their search. To investigate, Liang Li and Edward Cox at Princeton University studied the movements of amoebas (Dictyostelium) in a Petri dish, recording the paths travelled by 12 amoebas, including every turn and movement straight ahead, for 8 to 10 hours per amoeba. Immediately after an amoeba turned right, it was twice as <select> </select>to turn left as right again, and vice versa, they told a meeting of the American Physical Society meeting in Denver, Colorado, last week. This suggests that the cells have a rudimentary <select> </select>being able to remember the last direction they had just turned in, says Robert Austin, a biophysicist at Princeton who was not involved in the study.",
