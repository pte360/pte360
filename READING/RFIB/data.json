		"question": "Impressionism was a nineteenth century art movement that began as a loose association of Paris-based artists who started publicly exhibiting their art in the 1860s. Characteristics of Impressionist painting include visible brush strokes, light colors, open composition, emphasis on light in its changing qualities (often accentuating the effects of the passage of time), ordinary subject matter, and unusual visual angles. The name of the movement is derived from Claude Monet’s Impression, Sunrise (Impression, soleil levant). Critic Louis Leroy<span id=\"blank\"></span> coined the term in a satiric review published in Le Charivari. Radicals in their time, early Impressionists broke the rules of <span id=\"blank\"></span> painting. They began by giving colors, freely brushed, primacy over line, drawing<span id=\"blank\"></span>_from the work of painters such as Eugene Delacroix. They also took the act of painting out of the studio and into the world. Previously, not only still lives and portraits, but also landscapes had been painted indoors, but the Impressionists found that they could capture the momentary and transient effects of sunlight by painting en plain air (in plain air).",

This is what<span id=\"blank\"></span> tissue massage aims to break.” The way to do this, as I found out under Ogedengbe’s elbow, is to apply pressure to the point, stopping the blood flow, and then to release, which causes the brain to flood the affected area with blood, encouraging the<span id=\"blank\"></span> to relax. At the same time, says Kippen, you can fool the tensed muscle into relaxing by applying pressure to a <span id=\"blank\"></span> one nearby. “If you cause any muscle to contract, its opposite will expand.

The Impressionists wanted to depict real life, to paint straight from nature, and to capture the changing effects of light.

The other leading Impressionists included Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, Eduard Manet, Camille Pissarro, Pierre-Augusté Renoir and Alfred Sisley, but only Monet remained devoted to Impressionist ideas throughout his career. Monet, Renoir, and Sisley, who met as students and enjoyed painting in the open air — one of the hallmarks of Impressionism, formed the core of the Impressionist group in the early 1860s. They met other members of the Impressionist circle through Paris café society. They never made up a formal group, but they organized eight group exhibitions between 1874 and 1886, at the first of which the name Impressionism was applied. Their styles were diverse, but all<span id=\"blank\"></span> with effects of light and movement created with distinct brushstrokes and (D) of color dabbed side-by-side on the canvas rather than mixed on the palette.

The name of the movement is derived from Claude Monet's Impression, Sunrise (Impression, soleil levant). Critic Louis Leroy <span id=\"blank\"></span> coined the term in a satiric review published in Le Charivari.

They met other members of the Impressionist circle through Paris café society.

Twenty-six boys (11.4±0.8 years) participated and performed a range of sedentary <span id=\"blank\"></span> (resting, watching television and sedentary gaming), playing AVGs (Nintendo® Wii Bowling, Boxing, Tennis, and Wii Fit Skiing and Step), walking and running including a <span id=\"blank\"></span> fitness test. During all activities, oxygen uptake, heart rate and EE were determined. The AVGs resulted in a significantly higher EE compared to rest (63-190%, p=0.001) and sedentary screen-time activities (56-184%, p=0.001). No significant differences in EE were found between the most <span id=\"blank\"></span> video games and walking. There was no evidence to suggest that gaming experience or aerobic fitness influenced EE when playing AVGs. In conclusion, boys expended more energy during active gaming compared to sedentary activities. Whilst EE during AVG is gamespecific, AVGs are not intense enough to contribute towards the 60min of daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity that is currently recommended for children.",
