The new research bases its assertions on the results of the study of the DNA from aboriginal hair collected throughout a series of expeditions carried out between the years 1926 and 1963. The University of Adelaide is responsible for this project, since it sent researchers to settlements across Australia, from where a lot of information regarding aboriginal cultures were collected.

      "audio_script":"The Trojan War is the name given to a mythological conflict between the Greeks and the inhabitants of Troy which supposedly took place in the last period of the 12th century BC, and supposedly lasted ten years. Most historians claim that the event never actually happened, despite the fact that renowned Greek historians such as Herodotus regarded it as being historically true. Be it as it may, in the 19th century, excavations were carried out at the site of ancient Troy and it was proven that the events were indeed only one more of Homer’s inventions. However, some scholars have dedicated much of their careers in finding out what the causes of the war could have been -- assuming that it really took place. Legend attributes its origin to a romantic motive: to rescue Helena, the daughter of Zeus, who had been abducted by Paris, the second son of King Priam of Troy.",

One of the reasons is that it occurs during the whole year in the tropics, as mosquitoes prosper in any season. This disease is responsible for the death of more than one million people every year in India. Concerning temperate regions, malaria can also have an impact during warm weather, when mosquito flight is possible. The group of mosquitoes guilty of transmitting malaria is called anopheles. The majority of these insects are only active at night, thus tropical residents may go into malarious areas with reasonable safety in the daytime; but after the sun sets, anopheles seek human blood. Therefore, one way to avoid being bitten is by installing wire or plastic nets on doors and windows, or simply by remaining indoors after dark.",

Well, the standard explanation was once summed up by the British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and she called poverty a personality defects a lack of character. Basically, now I’m sure not many of you would be so blunt to call it as a defect, however it is still debatable. The reasons for why poor people make poor decisions is the lack of money, they would eat less because there is not enough money to feed themselves well, when they don’t have money, savings is out of question, they do not have time and any fat to exercise for may be, but on the contrary they are addicted to smoking and drinking which is the question, how do they afford this?",

This ecosystem is one of the fascinating paradoxes of the biosphere: how do clear, and thus nutrient-poor, waters support such prolific and productive communities? Part of the answer lies within the tissues of the corals themselves. Symbiotic cells of algae known as zooxanthellae carry out photosynthesis using the metabolic wastes of the coral thereby producing food for themselves, for their corals, hosts, and even for other members of the reef community. This symbiotic process allows organisms in the reef community to use sparse nutrient resources efficiently. Unfortunately for coral reefs, however, a variety of human activities are causing worldwide degradation of shallow marine habitats by adding nutrients to the water. Agriculture, slash-and-burn land clearing, sewage disposal''and manufacturing that creates waste by-products all increase nutrient loads in these waters. Typical symptoms of reef decline are destabilized herbivore populations and an increasing abundance of algae and filter-feeding animals. Declines in reef communities are consistent with observations that nutrient input is increasing in direct proportion to growing human populations, thereby threatening reef communities sensitive to subtle changes in nutrient input to their waters.",

This theory postulates that the families must be related, based on the assumption that complex behavior, such as web building, could evolve only once. According to Kullman, web structure is the only characteristic that suggests a relationship between families. The families differ in appearance,''structure of body hair, and arrangement of eyes.
