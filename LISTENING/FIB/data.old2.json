Start with climate change: most roses in the U.S. and Europe are imported from warmer climes. All that flying and trucking adds thousands of metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Then there's all the water needed to, well, water the flowers. And the runoff fouled by copious {{BLANK}}<span class='fib_answer'>quantities</span>of pesticides needed to make the roses look perfect. There's also the wildlife and workers poisoned by all that fumigation. Add to that habitat {{BLANK}}<span class='fib_answer'>destruction</span>where floral plantations displace native forest and wetlands. Finally, there's the refrigeration needed to keep those blooms fresh. The {{BLANK}}<span class='fib_answer'>electricity</span>is often produced by burning fossil fuels, and the refrigerant gases also exacerbate climate change. A more sustainable and, possibly, more romantic {{BLANK}}<span class='fib_answer'>approach</span>is to go with flowers certified by outfits like VeriFlora, or even better, whatever flowers are in season locally.

When an asthma attack hits, the airway shrinks and makes breathing difficult. To keep air flowing, the sufferer must take medication to relax the passage's {{BLANK}}<span class='fib_answer'>muscles</span>and open it back up. But a couple years ago, researchers discovered airways contain bitter taste{{BLANK}}<span class='fib_answer'>receptors</span>like the ones on the tongue. After exposure to bitter  {{BLANK}}<span class='fib_answer'>substances</span>the receptors can expand the airway more quickly and more effectively than the most commonly used treatment. Researchers {{BLANK}}<span class='fib_answer'>examined</span>airway tissue to learn why bitterness makes the muscles relax. During an asthma attack, calcium flows into the cells of the airway and contributes to muscle contraction. But bitter substances block the  {{BLANK}}<span class='fib_answer'>channels</span>that allow calcium into cells, which relaxes the tightened tissue. And that's the opposite of a bitter pill.",

They are two of the last four nations that have not {{BLANK}}<span class='fib_answer'>eliminated</span>the disease. In Afghanistan, most cases were in {{BLANK}}<span class='fib_answer'>southern</span>provinces under Taliban control. In Pakistan, many were in the remote tribal border areas where Osama bin Laden is still being pursued and local {{BLANK}}<span class='fib_answer'>militants</span>are battling the government. Polio experts see the territory differently: as one 'epidemiological block' with two transmission corridors, one in the mountainous north, where cases of the polio {{BLANK}}<span class='fib_answer'>strain</span>known as Type 1 are common, and one in the flatter south, where Type 3 prevails. Tribes migrate east-west across the borders, following harvests, {{BLANK}}<span class='fib_answer'> trade</span>routes and jobs. Polio went as far southeast as Karachi, where there is no fighting, but immunization drives 'remain weak,' the report said. Crowded {{BLANK}}<span class='fib_answer'> slums</span>and petty corruption disrupt efforts, an expert said. The report spoke of a{{BLANK}}<span class='fib_answer'>breakthrough</span>in August when the Taliban started letting vaccinators work in their territory. 'We dialogue with NATO and tell them, 'These are the days of our campaigns, these are our people ' don't {{BLANK}}<span class='fib_answer'>bomb</span>them!'' said Dr. Bruce Aylward, the campaign's director.

The new guidelines are outlined in April 20 issue of The Annals of Internal Medicine, in an article that noted that about 16 million Americans have Type 2 diabetes and that 800,000 new cases are {{BLANK}}<span class='fib_answer'>diagnosed</span>every year. The lead author of an article accompanying the guidelines, Dr. Sandeep Vijan of the University of Michigan, said that 'almost everyone with Type 2 diabetes should be on a statin.' The {{BLANK}}<span class='fib_answer'>average</span>age at diagnosis is 48, and even many patients under 55 have high blood pressure as well as diabetes, he said. Traditionally, diabetes treatment has{{BLANK}}<span class='fib_answer'>focused</span>on regulating blood sugar levels by careful control of {{BLANK}}<span class='fib_answer'>diet</span>or through insulin injections.

Heart disease is, in fact, the more serious threat. Up to 80 percent of diabetes patients will develop heart problems or die of them, the article said.

He ranked control of lipids, the fats in the blood {{BLANK}}<span class='fib_answer'>stream</span> that can affect coronary health, second, ahead of glucose {{BLANK}}<span class='fib_answer'>regulation</span>.",

It was a gritty, documentary-style spot, {{BLANK}}<span class='fib_answer'>featuring</span>a surgeon talking to the camera, then showing the patient he was about to operate on. The patient was a man whose toes were blackened and {{BLANK}}<span class='fib_answer'>rotting</span>away. The image of the foot was extremely {{BLANK}}<span class='fib_answer'>disgusting</span>. 'It's gangrene,' the surgeon said, and then he drew on the man's leg with a market to show where he was about to take his {{BLANK}}<span class='fib_answer'> hacksaw</span>and cut off the leg.
