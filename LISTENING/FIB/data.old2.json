Start with climate change: most roses in the U.S. and Europe are imported from warmer climes. All that flying and trucking adds thousands of metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.

There's also the wildlife and workers poisoned by all that fumigation. Add to that habitat {{BLANK}}where floral plantations displace native forest and wetlands.

Represented in sound, you can hear a small upwards sweep in frequency, in the data, if you listen closely.

'Oh yeah, absolutely, so it gives us an understanding of {{BLANK}}all the nitty-gritty of what's going on after the merger takes place.' Kunal Mooley, an astrophysicist at Caltech. First, he says, the stars collided, creating a massive, black hole_like object, which started sucking up the cloud of neutron-rich cosmic debris left over from the crash. But its {{BLANK}}was limited. 'It cannot eat all of it, so some bit of it basically escapes.' Those escaping leftovers spewed outward into space, as a powerful jet. But along the way, Mooley says, the jet appears to have interacted with that cloud of neutron-rich material, blowing up a sort of cocoon within the debris {{BLANK}}around the collision. Until finally, the jet burst out and slammed into interstellar space releasing yet more radiation we could detect here on Earth.",
